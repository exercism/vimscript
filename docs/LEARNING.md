## LEARNING

Vim comes with great documentation built in already. The interface to the
documentation is the `:help` command.

For an introduction, see `:h user-manual`.

Almost all Vim installations also come with an interactive tutorial:

```
$ vimtutor
```

Vim is decades old and still popular. You will find a lot of resources about it
on the web, some better than others. The good ones are listed
[here](http://www.exercism.io/languages/vimscript/resources).
