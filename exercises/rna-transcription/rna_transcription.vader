Before:
  unlet! input expected

Execute (RNA complement of cytosine is guanine):
  let input = "C"
  let expected = "G"
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (RNA complement of guanine is cytosine):
  let input = "G"
  let expected = "C"
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (RNA complement of thymine is adenine):
  let input = "T"
  let expected = "A"
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (RNA complement of adenine is uracil):
  let input = "A"
  let expected = "U"
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (RNA complement):
  let input = "ACGTGGTCTTAA"
  let expected = "UGCACCAGAAUU"
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (correctly handles invalid input (RNA instead of DNA)):
  let input = "U"
  let expected = ''
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (correctly handles completely invalid DNA input):
  let input = "XXX"
  let expected = ''
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)

Execute (correctly handles partially invalid DNA input):
  let input = "ACGTXXXCTTAA"
  let expected = ''
  AssertEqual expected, ToRna(input)
