Before:
  unlet! input expected

Execute (no allergies means not allergic):
  let input = 0
  AssertEqual 0, AllergicTo(input, 'peanuts')
  AssertEqual 0, AllergicTo(input, 'cats')
  AssertEqual 0, AllergicTo(input, 'strawberries')

Execute (is allergic to eggs):
  let input = 1
  AssertEqual 1, AllergicTo(input, 'eggs')

Execute (allergic to eggs in addition to other stuff):
  let input = 5
  AssertEqual 1, AllergicTo(input, 'eggs')
  AssertEqual 1, AllergicTo(input, 'shellfish')
  AssertEqual 0, AllergicTo(input, 'strawberries')

Execute (no allergies at all):
  let input = 0
  let expected = []
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to just eggs):
  let input = 1
  let expected = ['eggs']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to just peanuts):
  let input = 2
  let expected = ['peanuts']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to just strawberries):
  let input = 8
  let expected = ['strawberries']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to eggs and peanuts):
  let input = 3
  let expected = ['eggs', 'peanuts']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to more than eggs but not peanuts):
  let input = 5
  let expected = ['eggs', 'shellfish']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to lots of stuff):
  let input = 248
  let expected = ['strawberries', 'tomatoes', 'chocolate', 'pollen', 'cats']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (allergic to everything):
  let input = 255
  let expected = ['eggs', 'peanuts', 'shellfish', 'strawberries', 'tomatoes', 'chocolate', 'pollen', 'cats']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (ignore non allergen score parts):
  let input = 509
  let expected = ['eggs', 'shellfish', 'strawberries', 'tomatoes', 'chocolate', 'pollen', 'cats']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)

Execute (no allergen score parts without highest valid score):
  let input = 257
  let expected = ['eggs']
  AssertEqual expected, List(input)
