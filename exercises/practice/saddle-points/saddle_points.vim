" Given a 2D matrix of tree heights, return a list of
" saddle points that are the tallest in their row
" and the shortest in their column. The list can be
" returned in any order.
"
" Example:
"   :echo SaddlePoints([[4, 5, 4],
"                       [3, 5, 5],
"                       [1, 5, 4]])
"   [{'row': 1, 'column': 2},
"    {'row': 2, 'column': 2},
"    {'row': 3, 'column': 2}]
"
