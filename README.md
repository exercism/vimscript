### [Vim logo](https://github.com/exercism/xvimscript/tree/master/img/icon.png)

Since Vimscript is part of the Vim text editor, Vimscript alone does not have its own logo, and a modified Vim logo is used instead.
[Vim's license](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html#license) does not specify the terms of use for the Vim logo, but we believe that adapting it, by changing the colour scheme, falls within fair use.

The logo is used on Exercism to identify the Vimscript language, not Exercism as a whole.
